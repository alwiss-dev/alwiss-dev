## 👋 Hi, I'm Mert

I'm a software-focused builder interested in **backend systems, scalable architectures, and product-oriented development**.  
I enjoy designing systems that are **performant, maintainable, and realistic to run in production** — not just demos.

### 🧠 What I work with
- **Languages:** JavaScript (Node.js), TypeScript, Rust (learning & tooling)
- **Backend:** REST APIs, WebSockets, Microservices
- **Frontend:** React-based UIs
- **Databases:** Redis, SQL-based systems
- **Infrastructure:** Linux servers, Docker, reverse proxies
- **Focus areas:** Performance, security, scalability, clean architecture

I care deeply about **long-term sustainability**, developer experience, and building products that can actually grow.

## 🚀 Fling

**Fling** is a Turkey-focused, modern **real-time chat & community platform** infrastructure.

It is **not a Discord clone** — the goal is to build a more controllable, customizable, and performance-oriented communication system designed with local needs and long-term operation in mind.

### Key ideas behind Fling
- Real-time messaging with WebSocket-based architecture
- Modular and extensible backend design
- Microservice-friendly structure
- Performance-oriented data flow and caching
- Security-first approach (tokens, rate limiting, access control)
- Built to evolve with new services, workers, and tooling

Fling is under active development and aims to be a **practical, production-ready foundation** rather than an experimental project.
