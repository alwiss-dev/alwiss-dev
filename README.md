## 👋 Hi, I'm Mert

I'm a **software developer and system-oriented builder** focused on designing **custom architectures, scalable backends, and long-term maintainable products**.  
Rather than following trends blindly, I prefer **understanding how systems work end-to-end** — from server management to application logic and user experience.

I enjoy building **real-world systems** that are meant to run, scale, and survive in production environments.

## 🧠 Technical Skills & Experience

### 💻 Programming Languages
- **C# / .NET** – backend systems, APIs, background services
- **JavaScript (Node.js)** – real-time services, APIs, tooling
- **TypeScript** – safer large-scale application development
- **Python** – scripting, automation, backend utilities
- **Rust** – performance-critical tools, workers, and side services

### ⚙️ Backend & Architecture
- Custom backend architectures (monolith → modular → microservices)
- RESTful APIs & WebSocket-based real-time communication
- Authentication systems (JWT, refresh tokens, session handling)
- Rate limiting, access control, and security-focused design
- Cache-first data strategies using Redis
- Event-driven and message-based system design

### 🎨 Frontend
- **React / React.js** – modern, component-based UI development
- State management and API-driven UI architectures
- Performance-focused frontend structure

### 🗄️ Databases & Caching
- Redis (caching, pub/sub, real-time data)
- SQL-based databases (schema design, optimization)
- Data consistency and performance tuning

### 🖥️ Infrastructure & Server Management
- Windows server administration
- Reverse proxies (Nginx, Cloudflare setups)
- Docker & container-based deployments
- Basic CI/CD pipelines
- Monitoring, logging, and production debugging
- Performance optimization at system level

### 🧩 Engineering Mindset
- Clean and readable code over quick hacks
- Systems designed for growth, not just MVPs
- Strong focus on maintainability and observability
- Preference for simple, controllable solutions over complex abstractions

## 🚀 Fling

**Fling** is a modern **real-time chat & community platform** infrastructure, designed with **custom architecture and performance-first principles**.

It is **not a Discord clone**.  
The goal is to build a more **controllable, customizable, and locally sustainable** communication system — especially suited for Turkey-focused communities and long-term operation.

**Core ideas behind Fling:**
- WebSocket-based real-time messaging
- Modular and extensible backend design
- Microservice-ready architecture
- Redis-backed data flow and caching
- Security-first approach (tokens, rate limiting, permissions)
- Built to evolve with additional services, workers, and tooling

Fling is under active development and aims to become a **production-ready foundation**, not just a prototype.
