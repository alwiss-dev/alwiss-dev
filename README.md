## Hi, I'm Mert

I'm a software developer who builds systems focused on creating custom architectures, scalable backends, and maintainable products. Instead of blindly following trends, I like to understand how systems work from start to finish—covering server management, application logic, and user experience.

I enjoy creating real-world systems that are designed to run, scale, and function well in production environments.

## Technical Skills & Experience

### Programming Languages
- **C# / .NET** – backend systems, APIs, background services
- **JavaScript (Node.js)** – real-time services, APIs, tooling
- **TypeScript** – safer development for large-scale applications
- **Python** – scripting, automation, backend utilities
- **Rust** – tools, workers, and side services that focus on performance

### Backend & Architecture
- Custom backend architectures (monolith, modular, microservices)
- RESTful APIs and real-time communication via WebSocket
- Authentication systems (JWT, refresh tokens, session handling)
- Rate limiting, access control, and design focused on security
- Cache-first data strategies using Redis
- Design based on events and message-driven systems

### Frontend
- **React / React.js** – modern, component-based user interface development
- State management and UI architectures driven by APIs
- Frontend structure focused on performance

### Databases & Caching
- Redis (caching, pub/sub, real-time data)
- SQL-based databases (schema design, optimization)
- Data consistency and performance tuning

### Infrastructure & Server Management
- Windows server administration
- Reverse proxies (Nginx, Cloudflare setups)
- Docker and container-based deployments
- Basic CI/CD pipelines
- Monitoring, logging, and debugging in production
- Performance optimization at the system level

### Engineering Mindset
- Clean and readable code is preferred over quick fixes
- Systems should be designed for growth, not just MVPs
- Strong emphasis on maintainability and observability
- Favor simple, controllable solutions instead of complex ones

## Fling

**Fling** is a modern real-time chat and community platform infrastructure built on custom architecture and performance-first principles.

It is not a Discord clone. The aim is to create a more controllable, customizable, and sustainable communication system, especially for communities focused on Turkey and long-term operation.

**Core ideas behind Fling:**
- WebSocket-based real-time messaging
- Modular and extensible backend design
- Architecture ready for microservices
- Data flow and caching supported by Redis
- Security-first approach (tokens, rate limiting, permissions)
- Built to grow with additional services, workers, and tools

Fling is actively being developed and aims to be a production-ready foundation, not just a prototype.
